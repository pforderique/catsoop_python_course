<section>Intro</section>

Welcome to **Lesson 3: “You make my code go round right round”** — today you’ll learn how to make your code *repeat itself* and handle *lists of data*! 🔁

So far, you’ve worked with single numbers or strings. But what if you had a **bunch** of values — like all your recent purchases or all your mile splits from a run?
That’s where **lists** and **loops** come in.

---

<section>Scenario</section>

You’ve been racking up credit card points like a pro 💳. But calculating them manually for every purchase? Boring.
Let’s automate that using **lists** to store your purchases and **loops** to calculate total reward points.

By the end of this lesson, you’ll have your very own **Credit Card Points Simulator!** 🪙

<section>What Are Lists?</section>

A **list** stores multiple items in a single variable.

```python
purchases = [120.50, 15.99, 230.10, 89.75]
```

You can access specific items using **indexes**, which in 99% of programming
languages actually start at **0** (not 1!):

```python
print(purchases[0])  # first item → 120.50
print(purchases[2])  # third item → 230.10
```

You can even change a value:

```python
purchases[1] = 18.99
```

And add new ones:

```python
purchases.append(42.75)
```

Now the list looks like:

```python
[120.5, 18.99, 230.1, 89.75, 42.75]
```

Note that the last index of a list will always be **one less** than the length
of the list, since we start counting at 0. For example, the list above has 5
items, but the last index is 4, so we can access it with `purchases[4]`.

Trying to access an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error 😔:
```python
print(purchases[5])  # IndexError: list index out of range
```

<section>Check-in Questions</section>

<question multiplechoice>
csq_prompt = "What index represents the *first* item in a Python list?"
csq_options = ["0", "1", "first", "None"]
csq_soln = 0
csq_soln_mode = "index"
csq_explanation = "Python lists start counting from 0!"
</question>

<question multiplechoice>
csq_prompt = "Which of the following adds a new item to a list?"
csq_options = ["list.add()", "list.append()", "list.insert()", "list.put()"]
csq_soln = 1
csq_soln_mode = "index"
csq_explanation = "Use `.append()` to add an item to the end of a list."
</question>

---

<section>Removing Items</section>

You can also remove items with `.remove()` or `.pop()`:
```python
purchases.remove(89.75)  # removes the first occurrence of 89.75
purchases.pop(0)         # removes the item at index 0 (first item)
purchases.pop()          # removes the last item by default, if no index is given
```

---

<section>Loops</section>

Now that you have a list, how do you *use* it? Enter **loops**.
A loop lets your code repeat something for each item in a list.

```python
purchases = [120.5, 15.99, 230.1]

for purchase in purchases:
    print(purchase)
```

Output:

```
120.5
15.99
230.1
```

You can even keep a running total:

```python
total = 0
for purchase in purchases:
    total = total + purchase

print(total)
```

Output:

```
366.59
```

That’s the sum of all your purchases!

<question pythoncode>
csq_prompt = """Write a function called `length(lst)` that takes a list `lst` and returns the number of items in it."""
csq_initial = """def length(lst: list) -> int:
    # your code here
    return 0  # placeholder
"""
csq_soln = """def length(lst):
    count = 0
    for _ in lst:
        count += 1
    return count
"""
csq_npoints = 2
csq_tests = [
    {'code': 'ans = length([1,2,3]) == 3'},
    {'code': 'ans = length([]) == 0'},
    {'code': 'ans = length([10]) == 1'}
]
</question>

Note: this function is SO important, that Python has a built-in function version called `len()`!
Try replacing your `length()` implementation by just returning `len(lst)` instead!

---

<section>While Loops</section>

There’s another kind of loop: `while`. It repeats *while* a condition is true.

Example:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Looping...")
    count = count + 1
```

This prints “Looping...” five times.

<question multiplechoice>
csq_prompt = "Imagine you needed to iterate until some condition is true, but dont know how many iterations it will take. Should you use a for loop or while loop?"
csq_options = [ "for loop!", "while loop!" ]
csq_soln = 0
csq_explanation = "Use a while loop when you dont know how many iterations it will take to meet the condition."
</question>

You’ll use `for` loops most of the time, but `while` loops are great when you don’t know how many times you’ll need to repeat something.

<section>Mini Challenge</section>

<question pythoncode>
csq_prompt = """Given a list called `nums`, use a `for` loop to print each number **multiplied by 2**.
For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, it should print `2`, `4`, and `6`.
"""
csq_initial = """nums = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# your loop here!

"""
csq_soln = """nums = [5, 10, 15, 20]
for n in nums:
print(n * 2)
"""
csq_npoints = 2

csq_tests = [
{'code': 'ans = True'}
] </question>

---

<section>Combining Loops and Conditionals</section>

Don't forget about **conditionals**! You can combine them with loops to make decisions for each item.

Example: Only print out purchases over $100.
```python
purchases = [1.99, 150.00, 75.50, 200.00]

for purchase in purchases:
    if purchase > 100:
        print(purchase)
```

---

<section>Final Project: Credit Card Points Simulator</section>

Now it’s time to put those loops to work! 💳

You’ll create a **`calculate_points(purchases)`** function that takes in a list of purchase amounts and returns the total number of reward points earned.

Rules:

* Purchases under $50 earn 1 point per dollar
* Purchases between $50–$100 earn 1.5 points per dollar
* Purchases over $100 earn 2 points per dollar

<question pythoncode>
csq_prompt = """Finish the **`calculate_points(purchases)`** function following the rules above.
"""
csq_initial = """def calculate_points(purchases: list[float]) -> float:
  total_points = 0
  # loop through each purchase
  # calculate points based on amount
  # add to total_points

print(f"Total Points Earned: {total_points}")
return total_points
"""
csq_soln = """def calculate_points(purchases: list[float]) -> float:
total_points = 0
for purchase in purchases:
if purchase < 50:
total_points += purchase * 1
elif purchase <= 100:
total_points += purchase * 1.5
else:
total_points += purchase * 2

```
print(f"Total Points Earned: {total_points}")
return total_points
```

"""
csq_npoints = 3

csq_tests = [
{'code': 'ans = calculate_points([10, 60, 200])'},
{'code': 'ans = calculate_points([50, 75])'},
{'code': 'ans = calculate_points([120])'}
] </question>
